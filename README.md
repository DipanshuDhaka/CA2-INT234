📊 Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis & Visualization Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of Air Quality Index (AQI) data across multiple counties using data analytics and business intelligence tools. The objective is to transform raw environmental data into meaningful insights that help understand air pollution trends, identify high-risk regions, and support data-driven decision-making.

The project combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive dashboard development, making it a complete end-to-end data analytics solution.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze annual AQI trends across counties

Identify regions with poor and hazardous air quality

Compare pollution levels over time

Create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard

Enable filtering and drill-down for deeper insights

Present environmental data in a clear, visual, and impactful manner
